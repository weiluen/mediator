#Checking in with our fans . . .

###Hi everyone, here's a weekly check-in from your friends at Poli. . .

As you can see, our new blog is up and running! We're really excited to showcase our brand and content on a completely redesigned platform. For the engineers out there,
we're using Jekyll to generate our static website and then pushing it out onto S3! The current blog is inspired by Medium! We're hoping the clean format
will be a great way for us to keep our fans informed about Poli's development process!

We have a really exciting announcement for all of our fans! We've finally settled on a logo!

If you've been following our progress, you've seen our design evolve gradually. We've attempted to slowly distill the essential brushstrokes that compose a mountain down to a minimal set of lines. The final
Poli logo should be understood through that series of experimental designs. What we've arrived at is a logo with two overlapping triangles that represent a distant mountain. The cool blue colors are intended to give the viewer a feeling of coldness. 
And the downward stem gives the overall image a striking similarity to the letter P. This logo is the result of multiple interations and feedback from classmates, instructors, and other team members.

This past week at Poli, we've been hard at work on creating an exciting promotional video! One of our team members, Josh, came up with the concept for the video. He helped craft the story and we all played along. Josh is a storytelling and editing ninja, so you're in for a real treat! I don't want to give too much away, but our videos throughout the semester will all be linked together! There will be a cohesive story that's told by piecing the different videos together. 

###Here are some shots from the video shoot . . .

Josh was a wizard with the editing. We shot a ton of giggle-ridden scenes that he somehow stitched together to create a far better final edit than any of us could have hoped for. After multiple takes and a ton of redos (we have no Leos on the team), here's the finished product. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as much as we enjoyed filming it!

Overall, it's been a pretty productive week for your friends on the Poli team.
