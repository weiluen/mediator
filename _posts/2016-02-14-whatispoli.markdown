#What is Poli?


We know that last week’s blog post from Team TION had you dying to know what Poli is, and today we’re excited to finally be able to tell you all about it! But before we reveal Poli, we first ask you to consider the following…

Have you ever been in a situation where you’re wanting to ask a question, but don’t want people to judge or criticize you? Or have you ever had something to say that you feel is really important and people in your organization need to hear, but don’t want people to know that it’s coming from you? How about simply wanting to discuss things with people in your same university or company without them knowing your identity?

If you’ve said yes to any of the situations above (and even if you didn’t say yes, we bet that someday you’ll someday find yourself in one of these situations), then Poli is the perfect app for you! Poli is an anonymous, group-based messaging app with topical channels. Now, you may be asking yourself two questions: What exactly does all that mean, and how is Poli different from other apps such as Yik Yak?

To answer these questions, we’ll break down each of the core purposes of our app. Poli is meant to be anonymous, which means all users will be concealed with anonymity and secrecy. We display users with randomized icons rather than usernames, as usernames are unique and can be traced back to certain groups or users. No one knows who anyone else on the app is. Poli is group-based which means that unlike Yik Yak (which is location based), when using our app you are guaranteed that everyone you are talking with is from your same organization. For example, if you sign up with a UT email address, then everyone you talk to is guaranteed to be affiliated with UT as either a student, alumni, or faculty. This same principle also applies to any office or company, as long as everyone registers with their company email addresses. Lastly, Poli provides channels to smoothly direct the flow and relevance of users’ posts. In contrast to Yik Yak, where everyone posts on one general thread that has no clear topic or direction, Poli users can post in specific channels relevant to their ideas. In fact, if a pertinent channel can’t be found, you can create your own channel and start a new series of posts! For example, if you’re wanting to talk specifically about sports, then you simply go to the sports channel and find posts discussing about sports. If you feel like switching over to class/professor recommendations, then you can find posts solely devoted to recommendations with the click of a button.

Now that we’ve revealed what Poli is, we know that you’re dying to see what it looks like and when you can try it out! Have no fear, as Team TION is hard at work coming up with designs and wireframes for the app. As Albert Einstein once said…

Heeding the great scientist’s advice, Team TION has really taken this idea to heart as we’ve been cranking out design ideas to come up with the smoothest and best UI as possible for you guys (we promise the app will be more organized than this!).

We’re quickly closing in on our design, and are about to start creating our wireframes for a first demo of Poli coming up soon. Be on the look out for an update for our social media accounts to follow our progress on Poli!
