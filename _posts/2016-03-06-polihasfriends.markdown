Creating Poli has been a labor of love for us here at Team Tion. Each week we’ve dedicated time and energy to making sure we make the best app possible for our future users and this week was not an exception.

At its core, Poli is an app for UT students. We want UT Students to connect with Poli and view it as a useful tool and not just another useless anonymous messaging app that can cause unwanted trouble. We were able to get our survey out and we’re happy to say the data we received was interesting and helpful. 

Of the people who responded to our survey, 75 percent believe that verifying users by their university/workplace email address would be a good idea. With this type of percentage in our favor, we believe this is a key feature that will play an important role in Poli’s growth.

The data from the survey also yielded positive results when it came to our idea of making sure Poli had channels for topic focused chatting as 88.9 percent of responses were in favor. We were definitely excited to see this as a team and know we’re headed in the right direction with two key features!

With help from James, CJ, and Josh, our social media game also took a step up as we saw significant gains in our number of followers. We now have 60 Facebook likes (we gained 38 in one week!), 29 Twitter followers and 9 Instagram followers. These numbers are great for us as we still have social media strategies we are still implementing. We will continue to make steps increasing the buzz and information about Poli before our April release.   

So far I’ve bored you with numbers and data. They’re a necessary evil but the process of actually coding Poli is where the real action lies. 

Quan has taken the reigns of coding Poli and established himself as lead coder for the app. Over the past week he has created the ability to create post and comment on posts. He’s also created a home screen and the ability for posts to populate on the home screen. 

We are definitely enjoying all stages of Poli’s development phase and can’t wait to share more information and features! Until next time: #getpoli!
