##Hi fans!

###Last Week
Heads down work. We're hunkering down and going all in. It's Spring Break for some of UT, but not for you team here at Poli. We've got tons of work to push out before we can get ready for an app store submission. We have new technologies to learn (incorporating transition libraries), and we've got features to add for app store submission (post management and filters for inappropriate posts). Our social media presence has been growing thanks to our fans and one of our team members, Josh, is editing the next installment of the Poli video series. We hope you guys are as excited as we are. 

###Next Week

We hope you'll be enjoying your upcoming Spring Break holiday! The Poli team will be heads down still at work on our application! We will, however, be participating in the festivities at SXSW. One of our team members even purchased a badge!
The team is going to be pitching to students that we meet on the street and trying to refine our ideas by talking with industry experts! We'll be taking a careful look at major industry trends that are happening and trying to see if we can incorporate them into future iterations.
