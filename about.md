#POLI is anonymous . . .

Getpoli.co is where you can find all of the latest news on the POLI Anonymous Chat application. POLI is a fun app that's made by UT students for UT students.
We're a team of 4 UT students (3 Computer Science & 1 Journalism) trying to make it more convenient for students to connect with one another. Our goal is to make
a fun, safe, and an email-verified anonymous chat application. 

#POLI is about your opinion . . .

Here at POLI, we want you to be able to express your opinion without the fear of repercusion. We want to foster a community that's based on a shared identify.
We're exclusive. We don't let random A&M students or anyone but UT students chat on our application! Hook 'em. 

#POLI is better than the others . . .

When you fire up YikYak, how often do you get trolls and people from the outside community trying to monopoolize the conversation. What if students could have a more
focused forum for chatting about their classes, grades, and happenings? POLI solves these problems and guarantees that you're only talking to other students.
